This project is a database management and visualisation website for the professors of the IUTLCO.
It can :
- Choose which year is being displayed
- Show services by professor or by ressource
- Display various statistics in 'raw', 'by group' and 'PN vs Calais'
- Offers a 'Maquette' page to display the classes in the selected year by 'week numbers', or show the number of hours in a week or the total in a semester ordered by 'ressource and seance-type'
- Show the professors' informations to the users with 'part-time professor' privileges
- Enable the admin users to modify, delete and insert values into the database
